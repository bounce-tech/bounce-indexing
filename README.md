# Bounce Indexing

A [Ponder](https://ponder.sh) indexing project for tracking [Bounce Tech](https://bounce.tech/) leveraged tokens and trades on HyperEVM.

## Overview

This project indexes the **Bounce Tech leveraged token protocol**, a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that enables leveraged trading through tokenized assets. The indexer tracks leveraged token contracts created by the Bounce Tech factory contract, monitoring:

- **Leveraged Tokens**: Token metadata including address, creator, market ID, leverage settings, and ERC-20 properties (symbol, name, decimals)
- **Trades**: All mint and redeem operations for leveraged tokens
- **Transfers**: ERC-20 token transfers for leveraged tokens
- **Fees**: Fees paid from leveraged tokens (currently sent to treasury, with support for multiple destinations in the future)
- **Referrals**: User referral registrations and relationships
- **Rebates**: Rebate claims from the referral system

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Set up environment variables in `.env.local`:

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with:

```bash
HYPER_EVM_RPC_URL=your_rpc_url_here
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The dev server will:

- Connect to the database
- Start indexing from the configured start block
- Serve custom REST API endpoints at `http://localhost:42069`:
  - `/stats` - Protocol statistics
  - `/traded-lts` - Leveraged tokens traded by a user
  - `/users-trades` - All trades for a user
  - `/user-pnl` - Profit and loss for a user
  - `/latest-trades` - Latest 100 trades across all users
  - `/users` - All users from the user table
  - `/user` - Data for a single user
  - `/referrers` - All users with referral codes (referrers only)

## Schema

### `leveragedToken`

Stores metadata for each leveraged token created by the factory.

- `address` (primary key): Token contract address
- `creator`: Address that created the token
- `marketId`: Market identifier
- `targetLeverage`: Target leverage amount
- `isLong`: Whether the token is a long position
- `symbol`: ERC-20 symbol
- `name`: ERC-20 name
- `decimals`: ERC-20 decimals
- `asset`: Base asset symbol

### `trade`

Stores all mint and redeem operations.

- `id` (primary key): Unique trade identifier
- `isBuy`: `true` for mints, `false` for redeems
- `leveragedToken`: Address of the leveraged token (references `leveragedToken.address`)
- `timestamp`: Block timestamp
- `sender`: Address initiating the trade
- `recipient`: Address receiving the tokens
- `baseAssetAmount`: Amount of base asset

- `id` (primary key): Unique transfer identifier
- `timestamp`: Block timestamp
- `leveragedToken`: Address of the leveraged token (references `leveragedToken.address`)
- `sender`: Address sending the tokens
- `recipient`: Address receiving the tokens
- `amount`: Amount of tokens transferred
- `txHash`: Transaction hash of the transfer

### `user`

Stores user information including referral relationships and rebate tracking.

- `address` (primary key): User's Ethereum address
- `referralCode`: The user's own referral code
- `referrerCode`: The referral code the user used when joining
- `referrerAddress`: Address of the user's referrer
- `referredUserCount`: Number of users referred by this user

- `leveragedToken`: Address of the leveraged token (references `leveragedToken.address`)
- `timestamp`: Block timestamp
- `amount`: Amount of fee paid
- `destination`: Destination of the fee (e.g., "treasury")

**Note:** Currently, all fees are sent to the treasury. The system is designed to support multiple fee destinations in the future.

### Relations

- Each `leveragedToken` can have many `trade` records
- Each `trade` belongs to one `leveragedToken`
- Each `leveragedToken` can have many `transfer` records
- Each `transfer` belongs to one `leveragedToken`
- Each `leveragedToken` can have many `fee` records
- Each `fee` belongs to one `leveragedToken`

## Indexing

The project indexes events from the Bounce Tech protocol:

1. **Bounce Tech Factory Contract** (address imported from `@bouncetech/contracts` package)

   - `CreateLeveragedToken`: Creates a new leveraged token record and reads token metadata (symbol, name, decimals) from the contract

2. **Bounce Tech LeveragedToken Contracts** (factory pattern, with 24 pre-configured addresses)

   - `Mint`: Records buy trades
   - `Redeem`: Records sell trades
   - `ExecuteRedeem`: Records executed redemption trades
   - `Transfer`: Records ERC-20 token transfers
   - `SendFeesToTreasury`: Records fees paid from leveraged tokens

3. **Bounce Tech Referrals Contract** (address imported from `@bouncetech/contracts` package)
   - `AddReferrer`: Records when a user registers their referral code
   - `JoinWithReferral`: Records when users join with a referral code and links referee to referrer
   - `ClaimRebate`: Records rebate claims from the referral system
   - `DonateRebate`: Records rebate distributions to referrers and referees

The indexer uses block-based indexing starting from block `21549398` and processes new blocks in real-time.

## Querying

### API

- `user` (required): Ethereum address of the user

**Response Data:**

- User object containing trading and volume data (same structure as in the All Users endpoint):
  - `address`: User's Ethereum address (primary key)
  - `tradeCount`: Total number of trades made by the user (integer)
  - `mintVolumeNominal`: Total mint volume in nominal terms (as string, serialized from BigInt)
  - `redeemVolumeNominal`: Total redeem volume in nominal terms (as string, serialized from BigInt)
  - `totalVolumeNominal`: Total volume in nominal terms (as string, serialized from BigInt)
  - `mintVolumeNotional`: Total mint volume in notional terms (as string, serialized from BigInt)
  - `redeemVolumeNotional`: Total redeem volume in notional terms (as string, serialized from BigInt)
  - `totalVolumeNotional`: Total volume in notional terms (as string, serialized from BigInt)
  - `lastTradeTimestamp`: Timestamp of the user's last trade (as string, serialized from BigInt)

**Note:** This endpoint excludes referral-related fields. For referral data, use the `/referrers` endpoint.

**Example Request:**

```
GET http://localhost:42069/user?user=0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890

  "data": {
    "address": "0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890",
    "tradeCount": 42,
    "mintVolumeNominal": "10000000000",
    "redeemVolumeNominal": "8000000000",
    "totalVolumeNominal": "18000000000",
    "mintVolumeNotional": "50000000000",
    "redeemVolumeNotional": "40000000000",
    "totalVolumeNotional": "90000000000",
    "lastTradeTimestamp": "1704067200"
  },
  "error": null

```

**Example Error Response:**

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "data": null,
  "error": "Missing user parameter"
}
```

**Error Responses:**

- `400 Bad Request`: Missing or invalid user address parameter
- `404 Not Found`: User not found in the database
- `500 Internal Server Error`: Failed to fetch user

#### Referrers Endpoint

Get all users who have registered a referral code at `http://localhost:42069/referrers`.

**Query Parameters:**

- None

**Response Data:**

- Array of referrer objects, each containing only referral-related fields:
  - `address`: User's Ethereum address (primary key)
  - `referralCode`: The user's own referral code
  - `referred`: Number of users referred by this user (integer)
  - `earned`: Rebates earned as a referrer (as string, serialized from BigInt)

**Note:** This endpoint only returns users who have a `referralCode` (i.e., they are referrers). Volume and trade count fields are excluded as they are not directly related to referrals.

**Example Request:**

```
GET http://localhost:42069/referrers
```

**Example Success Response:**

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": [
    {
      "address": "0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890",
      "referralCode": "ABC123",
      "referred": 5,
      "earned": "1000000000"
    },
    {
      "address": "0x9876543210987654321098765432109876543210",
      "referralCode": "XYZ789",
      "referred": 0,
      "earned": "200000000"
    }
  ],
  "error": null
}
```
